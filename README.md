## Weekly CPD Reports

Week 1:
First week back, I am greeted with a review of the CPD report that I had done for the earlier study block in which we discussed the fact that I managed to miss an extra key skill on my final report which severly limited the marks that I got on the report itself but hopefully next time, I'll keep that in mind. Followed by a Game Demo day where other people got to play our current build of the game and we are going to use this feedback to improve our game. 

Week 2/3:
Getting back into the swing of things with a AR/VR Viva where we reviewed the VR game that we have been working on before we left for the holiday. The VR task itself was enjoyable to do but the time-frame was too short to make anything meaningful or functional for that matter. Being a completely new platform and not having a lot of development resources, I couldn't really execute my idea the way that I wanted to. But it still turned out alright so, woo. There was a lot of free-time during this week and so I focused on working on the game and starting to build up the hazards that were discussed in the meetings prior as the rest of the team worked on reviewing the feedback and seeing what we could do with it.

Week 4/5:
Started implementing the Spinning blade hazard for our game. I started with researching how to rotate an object with the axis being in the middle as well as adding variables such as the Speed and the direction to make sure that the designers can edit these properties to suit their needs. After a couple of meetings, the team decided that we needed more hazards to challenge the player as the game was too simple at this point with only the Fire hazard and the vines being present. Furthermore, we brainstormed some ideas that would be realistic to execute and I proposed a Swinging Axe to work on in the coming weeks as I was still working on spinning blade at the same time.

Week 6:
This week I had a deadline which was the research journal for the Comp250 which was a wiki task that the entire team had to contribute to. As such, I made sure that I researched my topic which was Supervised Learning. I also made sure to contribute to the other wiki pages as that was a part of the marking criteria. 

Week 7/8:
The spinning blade is pretty much done and has been added to the game. Now I need to start working on the Swinging blade which is very similar to the spinning blade except the swinging axe should only move between two points and do so with the finest smoothness possible. I researched a way to do it with a Quaternion which made the swing look as natural as possible. The issue here was that it needed an anchor point and depending on where that point was, the axe would swing but in the wrong direction. I needed some help from the other programmers to solve this. The deadline for the MUD that is a part of comp260 is coming up and I have been doing bits up to this point but the application itself is still very much unfinished. I still submitted something and attended the session but a referral is possible.

Week 9/10:
This week, I spent preparing my comp260 wiki contribution which was to research a topic called "Cross Site Scripting" which is is one of the most common vulnerabilities affecting websites online. Whilst at the same time, working on the last year's Graphics referral which is very challenging but I got it done by the end of the second week. In addition, to finish up the game I did a few UI pieces for the project such as the Settings screen and the Credits screen which I still need to fix.

Week 11:
Now the game is pretty much done and dusted and I have handed in my referrals and such so, the pressure has been lifted a little bit. The last deadline is the AI component which I have been developing on the side of the game project as I had some files from the prototype left over that we did at the start of the year and so I will iterate on it to make sure it is ready for the upcoming submission.

Short conclusion:
Overall, this study block was a lot less cramped and more spaced out which is always welcome compared to the first study block. However, the comp260 module is a big module to only have a single deadline on and the briefs for this module are demanding to say the least. Considering we haven't done much Python at all in the past study block and now we have to develop something on a completely different platform. I wish that these jumps between platforms were minimized and kept consistent with the other projects we are working on. Just so we can have at least one complete and solid understanding of a single platform instead of playing pick'n'mix.
